# Border-Gateway-Protocol

A scientific article i wrote on "Security of the Border Gateway Protocol" and its presentation for my MSc course on Advanced Topics in Information and Computer Systems at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. 

**Abstract**

Technological advancements have made communication one of the most important achievements of today's world. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard interdomain routing protocol of the Internet, which means it has a crucial role in current communications. Despite its importance, the conception and development of BGP didnâ€™t include any internal security mechanism, which has proven to be a major limitation. Security analyses in the last years have shown that the Internet routing infrastructure is prone to many vulnerabilities and attacks which can cause large scale outages. Since the adoption of BGP, several security features have been proposed, but only some minor tweaks have actually been implemented. In this paper, we conduct a review of current BGP threats and explore security proposals and standardization efforts, as well as their advantages and limitations.
